This repository holds the source for this Specification, part of the family of [Networked Media Open Specifications](https://specs.amwa.tv/nmos) from the [Advanced Media Workflow Association](https://amwa.tv)

<!-- INTRO-START -->

### What does it do?

- Enables Registration, Discovery, and Connection Management of H.264 Endpoints using the AMWA IS-04, IS-05 and IS-11 NMOS Specifications.

### Why does it matter?

- It helps ensure consistency between implementations offering NMOS control for H.264 endpoints.

### How does it work?

- It specifies what resources and attributes MUST be provided when using NMOS with [H.264][] streams.
- It specifies requirements for SDP when it is used with a transport supporting SDP transport files.
- It provides examples of how to use IS-04, IS-05 and IS-11 in the context of H.264 streams - specifically H.264 encapsulated in RTP as described in IETF [RFC-6184][]. It also describe to some extents how to use H.264 with RTP and other transports that encapsulate the H.264 video streams in an MPEG2-TS transport stream.
